   </div>

<dd>‘Engage’ is the second step of the DIPH which is documented in form 2. The stakeholders on the identified theme
  (hereafter referred to as DIPH stakeholders group) are the decision makers for planning service provision. The
  process will enhance collaboration and engagement between departments.</dd>
<dd>This step includes all those who are part of the step 1:</dd>
<dd><b>Discuss roles and define responsibility of each stakeholders pertaining to the identified theme: </b>The form
  will guide the discussion who will lead service delivery of the identified theme and which departments will provide
  supportive role keeping in mind their current level of engagement of the district.</dd>
<dd><b>Discuss how to collaborate with each other: </b>The themes identified during situation analysis provide
  overlapping areas of services where departments can collaborate. Helping each other by avoiding duplication of work
  is an important starting point. Some of the issues that can be discussed by the DIPH stakeholders group are:</dd>

<ul>
  <li>Are they aware of their roles and responsibilities?</li>
  <li>Do they have proper knowledge about the theme/issue?</li>
  <li>Are the geographical areas overlapping?</li>
  <li>What are the points where they are overlapping with other departments?</li>
</ul>

<dd><b>Discuss how to enhance engagement: </b>The engagement starts with coordination and collaboration between
  departments. Once the department specific roles and responsibilities are identified, the lead person should
  highlight the areas where different departments can contribute and how the private sector can be a part of the
  collaboration. This can be ensured through regular communication within the departments, via monthly meetings to
  resolve any issues that may arise during the implementation.</dd>

  The same stakeholders as Step 2 will attend this meeting. They represent the departments that actively provide the

  While discussing the possible solution and action required to solve, the stakeholders need to consider the most

<br />
<p>
  <b>Indicators:</b>Indicators are theme related coverage indicators captured by the national, regional, zone, or woreda level databases , which are commonly used at local level to track progress.
  There are three forms which are using these coverage indicators to track thematic work progress.
 
  <ul>
    <li>Form 1B–‘Health System Capacity Assessments’</li>
    <li>Form 4- ‘Plan’</li>
    <li>Form 5-‘Follow-Up’</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Each coverage indicator has been categorized based on their functional area. For example, the coverage indicator “Ambulance Service Response Rate” comes under “Quality Of Health Services” category.
</p>
<p>
  All coverage indicators are listed underthe menu-itemcalled‘Indicators List’. This list contains all the coverage indicators stored in the DIPH platform. The indicators are of three types, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential Indicators – These indicators are as per DHIS2 Ethiopia, and are similar to the ones available from DHIS2.
   These indicators can be added to a cycle from Form 1B or from Form 4 by users.</li>
<li>Optional Indicators – These indicators are based on the parallel health reporting formats.
  These indicators can be added to a cycle from Form 1B or from Form 4 by users.</li>
<li>Action Indicators– These indicators are theme specific and woreda specific indicators,
   which might be required by the woredas to measure or track specific aspect of the program,
    and for which an indicator is not already given in Essential or Optional indicators.
    These indicators can be created by users if not already available in cycle from Form 1B or from Form 4 by users.
     Users should observe caution while adding action indicators as they might already be available in the list, therefore, 
     we should first search and look for indicators definition before creating them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>To create</b> an indicatorclick on the ‘Create Indicator’ button on the top right corner of the section. To create an indicator one needs the following information:

<li><b>Source:</b> Source of indicator value.</li>
<li><b>Frequency:</b> frequency at which the indicator value has to be captured.</li>
</ul>
<p>

The delete functionality will always be available for the highest step filled for e.g. in the below image as all the steps are filled the delete button (in red) is available only for Step 5, which means the user can edit all other steps but can only delete the highest step’s filled form ( Step 5 here). Once the user deleted the Step 5 content, the delete button will automatically become available for Step 4. In brief the delete functionality will be available in the order Step5  Step 4  Step 3  Step 2  Step 1B  Step 1A

<dt>Follow-up of action points (Step 5)</dt>
<dd>1.Orient the sub-district (block) stakeholder’s of all the departments Health and non- health departments
  (Panchayat & Rural Development, and Child Development) about the indicators of follow –up action points and ensure
  they send the data by every 2nd working day of the month.</dd>
<dd>2.Follow-up with the heads of stakeholder departments; provide necessary instructions to capture the status of
  action-points at the sub- district (block) level.</dd>
<dd>3.There may be some action-points that need to be followed-up directly with district/state authorities like
  district magistrate, state health bodies (Principal health secretary, health mission director) for issues like
  recruitment, procurement, lobbying for policy change/bringing out government orders,</dd>
<dd>4.At district convergence level meetings (like Reproductive & Child Health and Public Health ) of the district,
  allocate 10-15 minutes to discuss the progress of the action plan with the sub-district (block) officials.</dd>
<dd>5.Every 10th working day of the month compile the action-plan status at the district-level, and share with DIPH
  district nodal officer.</dd>

      <h4>Basic Concept of Facilitation</h4>
  </div>
<br>

<dt>Handling dominating participants</dt>
<dd>Generally, it has been found that district level officials at the higher ranks take lead rolesin discussion during
  the meeting. This does not provide much space of staffs down the hierarchy toexpress theirviews. To break this
  process, team leader should allow them time & space to express their views without any tension/ fear (check Box-1).

<dt>Enhance participation</dt>
<dd>To deal ‘difficult’ or ‘emotionally charged’ participants, it’s vital to remember that the problem is their
  behaviour and not individually as a person. Chances are that at some level, the meeting isn't addressing their
  needs, or maybe they feel that the meeting is a waste of time because their opinion won't be considered when it
  comes to making the final decision. To avoid this conflict, accept their views/ ideas that they express during the
  meeting. It increases their ownership and it is also possible to increase their commitment to the outcomes, as well
  as improving behaviour in meetings.</dd>

<dt>Enhance interaction among departments</dt>
<dd>In general, it is found that participants loose their interest and remain silent due to lack of information and
  self-expressiveness. For example, in a meeting to address health issues, participants from other non-health
  department may lose their interest by thinking that health is not their domain or they are not an expert like the
  health department officials.</dd>
<dd>In order to engage them, the facilitator needs to turn the meeting into orientation mode. Approx 5-10 minutes
  session to orient participants about the issue to be discussed and its present situation through success story/
  experience sharing. It may increase their knowledge/ interest that assist them to speak and take part in the
  discussion.</dd>
